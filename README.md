# TinyUrl Project

TinyUrl is a URL shortening service designed for business clients who publish links to landing pages and online files. The service allows for URL shortening, click tracking, and identification of click sources.

## Features

- **Shortening**: Shortening URLs to obtain user-friendly and concise addresses.
- **Tracking**: Tracking the number of clicks and visits on each link.
- **Targeting**: Mapping different sources to the same link to identify the exposure brought by each source.

## Development Process

The project is developed using Node.js and MongoDB, following the Agile methodology.

### Sprint 1: Base API
- Creating the base API in Node.js.
- Setting up an initial database with `links` and `users` collections.
- CRUD operations for Links and Users.

### Sprint 2: Tracking
- Developing a redirect mechanism that redirects from a shortened URL to the original URL.
- Saving click data including the user's IP address.

### Sprint 3: Targeting
- Ability to associate each click with the source from which it originated.
- Adding parameters in the query string to identify click sources.

## System Requirements

- Node.js
- MongoDB
